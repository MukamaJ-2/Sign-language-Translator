## 🔒 Security Reminder

⚠️ **Important**: Your Personal Access Token was used in the git remote URL. For security:

1. **Revoke the current token** (since it was exposed):
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Find the token and click "Revoke"

2. **Generate a new token** if you need to push again:
   - Create a new token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Use it for future pushes

3. **Alternative**: Set up SSH keys for more secure authentication:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   # Then add the public key to GitHub Settings → SSH Keys
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:MukamaJ-2/Sign-language-Translator.git
   ```
